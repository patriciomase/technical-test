# Recommendations:

## Project setup in general:
1) Project could be forked from some github repo avoiding extra step of downloading the zip file just to drop the files in an empty repo.
2) There's no quick or intuitive way of running the app. (Apart from just open the html file with chrome directly). Having a basic server would be good.

## UX
1) The user can't specify new task title, description or image.
2) No way to filter tasks
3) Checkbox control doesn't have too much sense to indicate something is completed. When clicking it nothing happens.
4) There is not possible to delete any task or reorder.
5) Huge image being loaded and then resized to 160px width by css. Having a thumbnail version of that image would be great to show in there.
6) Consider a proper way of dealing with long descriptions. (Using some kind of expandable wrapper could be a good choice).

## Css review:
There are no big issues in the provided css but several things can be improved.
1) Using !important when there's no reason for.
2) Class names could be more declarative.
3) Small indentation and space issues.
4) Not really an issue with the css but design could be improved.

## Js review:
1) Uses `let` in several parts of the application without transpilation. Let doesn't have full support in modern browsers yet, or at least is risky.
2) Declaring a global variable for the task list in one file and passing it as param in a different file is confusing.
3) Several indentation issues mostly in the json file which provides the data. (taskList.js).
4) Concatenation mixed with interpolation in app.js looks at least confusing and not clear at all.
5) Global taskList variable is mutated in addTask function. It is accessible by scope but probably not the best practice.
6) There's data missing when creating a new task, several `undefined` are shown actually on the presentation.
7) Having Date objects mixed in what seems to be a json file got from a service is weird. It would be better to have a string in there and convert to date later on the application flow.
